## Proof: Floyd's cycle finding Algorithm (Hare and Turtle algo)  <img src="https://github.com/ankurbhatia24/ankurbhatia24.github.io/blob/master/assets/HomePage_Blogs/new_small.gif"> <br>
Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at different speeds. This algorithm can be used to detect cycle in linked lists in O(n) time and O(1) Space and also detect the position of start of the linked list. This video tutorial explains the concept and proof of the algorithm. <br>

## Paper Review on Ranknet  <img src="https://github.com/ankurbhatia24/ankurbhatia24.github.io/blob/master/assets/HomePage_Blogs/new_small.gif"> <br>
In this video, we understand abouthttps://github.com/ankurbhatia24/ankurbhatia24.github.io/blob/master/assets/HomePage_Blogs/HareAndTurtle.gif Ranknet. Learning to Rank using Ranknet (by Microsoft) is a Ranking Algorithm that is used to rank the results of a query. The ranking comparison is performed pairwise, no mapping to particular rank values is required and no rank boundaries are needed. Hence, this paper removes the need of performing ordinal regression. Also, this paper presents a probabilistic cost function and learning using Gradient Descent.<br>
